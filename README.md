Do you ever feel like enough is enough?  

Want to browse social media without constantly being barraged about your least favorite topic?  

With Serenity Now, you *can*.  

Imagine you love Reddit but can't stand reading *again and again* about your least favorite topic.  
Using the extension, simply add items to the list, and they will be blocked in your news feed.

This extension is released as a proof-of-concept especially as a way to edit page content while under the permission context of Chrome extension manifest `v3`.  

This product is **unsafe**, as this extension would further the ability for individuals to isolate their internet bubble to their liking.  The continued emphasis on this, *especially* in the context of social media, is a net societal harm.  As citizens of the world, we should seek to maturely debate, and tolerate opinions other than our own, rather than pretend they don't exist. 

This is not released to any extension store.  It is an excercise in free speech, MIT-licensed open source software, and not fit for any purpose.
